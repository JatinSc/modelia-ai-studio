# 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools.  
Below is a transparent breakdown of how AI supported the workflow:

---

## 🔹 UI / Design
- **Bolt AI** was used to explore and generate initial **UI design ideas**.  
- Helped with:
  - Layout structures and component sketches.
  - Styling suggestions (colors, spacing, TailwindCSS utilities).
  - Inspiration for making the UI modern and responsive.

---

## 🔹 Coding & Debugging
- **ChatGPT** was used for:
  - Writing and refactoring React + TypeScript code.
  - Debugging issues (e.g., TypeScript errors, test setup problems, async handling).
  - Improving component structure and reusability.
  - Suggesting fixes for Vitest + Testing Library test cases.
  - Explaining concepts (e.g., retry logic, mocking APIs, accessibility testing).

---

## 🔹 Documentation
- ChatGPT also assisted in drafting:
  - **README.md** for setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
  - **AI_USAGE.md** (this file).
  - Notes on testing, error handling, and project structure.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note
- All AI suggestions were **reviewed, edited, and tested manually** before inclusion.  
- Final implementation choices and code responsibility remain with the developer.  
- No private or sensitive data was shared with AI tools.
